# Customer-Churn-Prediction  
**Telecom - Customer Churn Prediction**

Churn prediction models are machine learning or statistical models used to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using a company's product or service—this is known as customer churn. These models help businesses identify at-risk customers so they can take proactive steps to retain them.

# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to customers who discontinue using the service. The goal is to build predictive models that can help the business identify customers who are at risk of leaving, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

## 🔍 Objective

- Analyze customer data and identify patterns related to churn behavior.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Train and evaluate various classification models.
- Predict churn on unseen data and assess model performance.

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following customer-related features:

- **Demographics** (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)  
- **Service details** (internet service, contract type, payment method)  
- **Account info** (tenure, monthly charges, total charges)  
- **Churn status** (target variable)

## 🧠 Models Planned

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
- XGBoost (optional)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

A robust machine learning model capable of predicting churn with high performance. The model can be used by telecom companies to proactively engage with high-risk customers and reduce churn rates.
